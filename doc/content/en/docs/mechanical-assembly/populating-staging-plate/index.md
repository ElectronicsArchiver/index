  Mounting components to the staging plate 
---

We now have the main structure of the machine assembled! Now we'll mount some components to the bottom of the staging plate.

## Overview

Refer to the images below for referencing where to mount parts on the staging plate.

## Pump mount

The first thing we'll mount to the staging plate is the {{<tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025">}}. This print suspends the pump using two rubber bands to ensure none of the vibration of the pump is transferred into the frame.

1. Start by press-fitting M3 nuts into the side recesses in the {{<tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025">}}.

2. Now we'll mount the pump in the {{<tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025">}} using a couple rubber bands. Start by grabbing the rubber band with both hands, giving it a half twist, and folding it over on itself, making two loops.

  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0740.JPG" alt="" >}}

3. Now stretch each rubber band over each pair of pegs on the {{<tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025">}}. Guide the pump between each pair of bands so that it's suspended in the {{<tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025">}}.

  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0744.JPG" alt="" >}}

4. Mount the {{<tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025">}} to the staging plate using two M3 x 10mm screws in the location shown below.

## Valve mount
Now we'll attach the {{<tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042">}} to the staging plate.

5. Press fit four M3 nuts into the recesses in the {{<tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042">}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-5.png" alt="four nut locations in the Valve Mount" >}}

6. Use two M3x8mm screws to attach the valve to the {{<tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042">}} as shown below.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-6.png" alt="attaching the valve to the valve mount with two screws" >}}

7. Use four M3x8mm screws to mount the {{<tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042">}} to the staging plate in the location shown below.

## Pneumatic Y splitter mount

8. Use an M3x30mm screw and an M3 nut to mount the pneumatic Y splitter to the staging plate as shown below.

## Bottom camera mount

9. Stack the {{<tooltip "Up Light Mount" "FDM-0019">}}, the Up Ring Light, and the {{<tooltip "Up Camera Mount" "FDM-0020">}} together. (Note: the Up Ring Light is not pictured here)
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-9.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack" >}}

10. Use four M3x30mm screws and four M3 nuts to attach the stack to the staging plate. The cable connector for the Up Ring Light should be facing down and to the left, away from the valve.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-10.png" alt="Up Camera Stack attached to the staging plate with the Up Ring Light's connector facing down and to the left" >}}

11. Loosen the screw on the camera so that we can adjust the camera's focus later. Even after doing so, it still might be difficult to rotate the lens. A light grip with some pliers and a gentle twist can help break the lens free and make it easier to rotate by hand.

12. Use four M2.5x8mm screws to mount the camera into the {{<tooltip "Up Camera Mount" "FDM-0020">}} by using the inner set of four holes and tapping directly into the plastic. Match the orientation to the image below.

## Nozzle Holder

13. Slide three M3 nuts into the slots in the back of the {{<tooltip "Nozzle Holder" "FDM-0024">}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-13.png" alt="Nuts inserted into the nozzle holder" >}}

14. Using three M3x8mm machine screws, tighten the {{<tooltip "Nozzle Holder" "FDM-0024">}} on top of the staging plate as shown below. Note: we will install the datum board later, ignore it in the photo below)
