LumenPnP kits are available for sale on the [Opulo Website][Website]. Machines are being used in active production daily. If you build or buy one, please help the project by documenting bugs with a GitHub issue.

**Please [read the wiki here][Wiki]!** The wiki covers information about the state of the project, contributing instructions, and frequently asked questions.

The LumenPnP is designed to be low-cost enough that someone could buy or build one to support making production runs at home or as a small business. It runs using [OpenPnP].

Along with the pick and place machine itself, the project also includes feeders designed to work with the machine. Powered feeders are in the final design phase. Having a proven validated design is the next goal of the project.

The LumenPnP's development process is being cataloged in a series of videos. A playlist of these can be found [here][Playlist].
